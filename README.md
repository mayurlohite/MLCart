# MLCart
MLCart is a basic ecommerce websites using ASP.NET Core 8 MVC. This repo is just a demo project that I've been working as I learn ASP.NET Core MVC. All product details are either from newegg, amazon or from the product website. This project design is inspired by nopcommerce, opencart, newegg and amazon.
